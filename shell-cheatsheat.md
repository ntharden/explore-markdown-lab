# Cheatsheat for Shell Commands

*A shell is a special user program that provides an interface to the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from the user and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.*

### File and Directory Manipulation:

- **mkdir:** create a directory
- **cp:** copies files and directories from the source path to the destination path. Accepts *source file/directory* & *destination file/directory*
- **mv:** moves files or directories; similar to **cp** but deletes file or directory from source path
- **rm:** removes files or directories
- **touch:** creates or updates a file
